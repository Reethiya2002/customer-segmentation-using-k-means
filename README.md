# 🧩 Customer Segmentation using K-Means and Streamlit

### 📊 Project Overview
This project segments customers based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**.  
It helps businesses identify customer groups for **targeted marketing strategies**.

### 🧠 Objective
To group customers into meaningful segments to understand purchasing behavior.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Streamlit (for interactive dashboard)
- Dataset: Mall Customers Dataset (Kaggle)
**scikit-learn (KMeans, StandardScaler, Elbow Method)** – machine learning for clustering  
### ⚙️ Steps Involved
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Applying K-Means Clustering  
4. Finding optimal clusters using Elbow Method  
5. Building an interactive Streamlit dashboard
